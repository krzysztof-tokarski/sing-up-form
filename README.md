# sing-up-form

Vanilla stack.

A sign-up form with some very simple validation.

It wasn't the point to implement responsiveness here, it's all about the desktop version at this point in the course, it displays alright in different resolutions / viewports. 

Probably will not revisit, don't see major areas for improvement.
