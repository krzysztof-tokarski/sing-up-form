# sing-up-form

Vanilla stack.

A sign-up form (frontend only) with some very simple validation.

First implementation of the dynamic units. 

It wasn't the point to implement responsiveness here, it's all about the desktop version at this point in the course, it displays alright in different resolutions / viewports. 

Probably will not revisit, don't see major areas for improvement, although I don't like the behaviour of the sidebar, so maybe I'll eventually sit down to iron that out at least.
